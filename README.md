A cool Discord bot

What is this?
-------------

This is a Discord bot I have developed for me and my friends' Discord server.

How can I use it?
-----------------

For now, the bot is only for use in my server. When it gets out of alpha (no pun intended), I will add support for other servers.

Legal stuff?
